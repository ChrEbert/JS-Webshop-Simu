# JS-Webshop-Simu




Although JavaScript doesn't seem to be the key technology for Webshops, it is a very interesting task to do so in terms of objectorientated programming (articles of the webshop with different features) and the usage of cookies for moving parameters to a another site.

The Files are also online: http://www.littleorange.de/garage/JS-Webshop-Simulation. To check the functionality "live" please follow the link or download the files alternatively on your computer and * open the file in this case with the Microsoft Edge Browser * (Chrome will not work, because cookies are only on uploaded html-documents allowed). For view the code, you can use the same files in this repository.
